    <div id="intro-content" >

    	Singapore has once again been ranked as the world's most expensive city for the 8th time in a decade. 
        It has faced a consistently high cost of living which has been further worsened due to the high inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in GST. 
        Prices haven risen by 8.1% in local-currency terms, which is the highest rate in 20 years. 
        The high cost of living has even become a significant source of mental health worries among Singaporeans.
        So, how "well" are Singaporeans coping with this rising cost of living? Let's find out!

<!-----------------------------------------------Income vs Increase in CPI Comparison Explanation----------------------------------------------->
<p class="income-inflation-explanation"> 
    <b><u>Analysis of Average Income Graph:</u></b> Monthly average household income has generally seen an increase over the years for all deciles. 
    From 2019 to 2020, almost all deciles saw a decrease in income except for those in the 2nd and 4th decile. However income started to increase again, more significantly than before, after 2020. <br><br>
    <b><u>Analysis of Yearly Percentage Change Graph and Table:</u></b> In the earlier years of 2016 to 2019, almost all deciles had an income growth that was above inflation rate, which meant that the income growth of most Singaporeans could generally support them through inflation.
    From 2019 to 2020, inflation rate dropped to a negative, but most income growth rates also dropped to a negative, and to a more significant extent.
    From 2020 onwards, inflation rate continued to increase, so did the income growth rate. But a portion of the population's income growth rate went below inflation rate, meaning that their income was becoming insufficient to support them through the rising cost of living.

    <div id= "expenditure-explanation">
        <p><b><u>Analysis of Pie Chart:</u></b> Singaporeans spend most on food, followed by transport and then recreation and culture. 
        This is reasonable given that expenditures for these 3 categories are made more often, either daily or more than once a month.
        The 'Others' category include expenditure on miscellaneous goods and services, including personal care services, social support services and insurance, and expenditure on alcoholic beverages and tobacco. <br><br>
        <b><u>Analysis of Bar Chart:</u></b> The categories that were more significantly impacted by inflation from 2018 to 2022 are transport, recreation & culture and food. Singaporeans spend most on these 3 categories, based on the trend observed in the pie chart.
        This shows that the impact of inflation is in fact rather severe as categories that make up a significant portion of one's household expenditure are more seriously affected by inflation than other categories.

                        The amount of support given to each employer depends on the sector they are in and how much their business has been affected by the pandemic.

        Conclusion

    <div id="conclusion-content">
        In conclusion, the data presented in the various graphs and charts highlight the impact of inflation on the income and expenditure patterns of Singaporeans. While the monthly average household income has generally seen an increase over the years, the pandemic has caused a temporary dip in income for most deciles in 2020. Although income started to increase again after 2020, a portion of the population's income growth rate went below inflation rate, which means that their income was becoming insufficient to support them through the rising cost of living. <br><br>

        The pie chart and bar chart reveal that Singaporeans spend most on food, transport, and recreation & culture. These categories are also more significantly impacted by inflation. The government has targeted these categories with its cash payouts and public transport vouchers. However, more can be done to support all Singaporeans, especially those from the middle income bracket, particularly in the area of transport.<br><br>

        Overall, the data suggests that while the government has introduced various measures to help Singaporeans weather the impact of the pandemic and inflation, it is important to continue monitoring the income and expenditure patterns of Singaporeans to ensure that everyone is adequately supported.<br><br>
